<p>The most notable fix this patch is for this remote code execution vulnerability that impacts Microsoft Exchange servers. It has a CVSS score of 9.1 out of 10 and allows attackers to run arbitrary ( and in case of an attack, most likely malicious) code as the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù user on the server using a specially crafted mail. As the system user has even more privileges than a local administrator account this is a serious issue. Microsoft has noted that this can only be done by a user who is authenticated on the server which would make an attack far less likely but this is not confirmed by the researcher that found this bug. We recommend all exchange users to check if their version is impacted <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-16875">here</a> and patch as soon as possible if you are running a vulnerable server. <br /></p>

<p>More critical Remote code Execution vulnerabilities have been found in other software as well. One was reported for Microsoft Windows and seven CVE‚Äôs where made public for similar issues in Sharepoint. An attacker can execute malicious code using a specifically crafted file in both so this is definitely a case where having well trained employees wary of suspicious files is really important. Obviously this shouldn‚Äôt be your only defense so make sure to apply the necessary patches as soon as possible here too. <br /></p>
