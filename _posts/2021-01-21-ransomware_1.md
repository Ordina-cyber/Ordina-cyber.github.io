“Another one bites the dust” by Queen – it is one of my favorite songs of all time and coincidentally one of my first thoughts when I hear new case that an organization has fallen victim to a ransomware. Numerous major companies fell victim to ransomware in 2020. One would believe that only large international organizations are being targeted; unfortunately that is not true. Small/medium sized companies, governments, educational institutions and even hospitals have been hit by ransomware.

Ransomware is a type of malware (malicious software) that encrypts the computer files of the victim with an unguessable password. Without this password, the victim is unable to access his/her files. The cybercriminal demands a ransom for the password.

Ransomware isn’t anything new as it has been popping up since 2010. An evolution of several factors are still observed in the damages, the modus operandi and the target groups. Especially, the sophistication of the attacks has improved for the worse. In the early days, ransomwares were very basic as it did not encrypt the data files (non-encrypting ransomware). Non-encrypting ransomware shows pornographic images and demands users to send a premium rate SMS to receive a code to remove these images. Criminals then started employing encryption that effectively encrypts system files (encryption ransomware).  However, early encryption ransomware was still so rudimentary that it used a lot of system resources thereby making the encryption detectable and thereby quickly remediated with back-ups. Nowadays you could say that the perpetrators are highly skilled criminals.

This is a typical process of a ransomware attack in these days: a cybercriminal compromises a system in the organization, maps the different systems on the network and increases their permissions to move through the network. Then they disable existing antivirus software, find and corrupt/encrypt/delete back-ups, and finally encrypt the data on all systems.

Furthermore, stealing data has also become part of ransomware modus operandi so that even if the company still has data back-ups, they are forced to pay a ransom to keep their data confidential. This type of ransomware is particularly called as doxware and/or leakware.
