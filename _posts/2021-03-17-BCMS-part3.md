If you are familiar with the Business Continuity Management (BCM) system, then you may know the terms Disaster Recovery Management (DRM) and Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP). Both BCM and DRM refer to a contingency management system, but how does  BCM and DRM differ? <br>

The short answer is that the scope is different. While DRM generally focuses on the recovery capability of key IT systems, BCM often covers holistic capabilities of the organization that is needed for responding  to a disruption and resuming/recovering the key businesses. You can see the difference more in BCP and DRP as below. <br>

Scope of BCP and DRP (*in general*)

Therefore, DRM is sometimes explained as a subset of BCM. Looking at ISO 22301: 2019, the international BCM standard, IT systems are listed as a type of resources (c.f. 8.3.4   Resource requirements). DRM can be considered as a management system that ensures the required resource are available. <br>

 However, it is not always necessary to develop an independent DRM. You can include the recovery procedures of the key IT systems in a BCP. Furthermore, you can call your contingency management system in your own way. The term Crisis Management and IT Service Continuity Management (c.f. ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)) are also often used to describe a contingency management system. What is more important is that your contingency management systems are consistent and relevant to your business objectives. <br>
