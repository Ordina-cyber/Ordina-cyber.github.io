## Firstly please tell us about your background.
I am a 25 year old computer science student from UCLL. My first career choice was to become a software developer. But after a few turbulent years, I realized that this was not what I want to do for the rest of my life. So I started to seek what my true passion is and I finally arrived at cyber security. More specifically, I love everything related to penetration testing and red teaming. My dream is to do this as a full time job.

## What made you choose Ordina?
During my school career, I met an Ordina security consultant Katarina when she was giving a presentation and class on how to start with ethical hacking. It was very interesting and she mentioned at that time that she was looking for an internship in this field. One year later, when I was searching for an internship, I reached out to Katarina and finally contacted Ordina as she recommended. I had a very pleasant conversation with the Practice Manager Jordy and instantly knew that this was the internship of my dreams.

## How has your time been at Ordina?
It has been a great experience. Everybody is super polite and friendly. And any question I had was answered very quickly. The internship itself was a good mix of different blue and red teaming exercises.  I feel that the people around me share the same passion as I do and that I can continue to learn a lot here. When I got offered a permanent job offer here, I didn’t hesitate for a moment.

## What do you think about your career?
This internship confirmed that I have finally found what I really want to do in the IT field. My passion for cyber security and penetration testing has just increased! The next step for me will be to get a few important certificates in this field. I look forward to working as a permanent member of the team here at Ordina!

## Finally, please share some advice for potential Ordina interns!
Dare to say what u truly want to do! My first assignment was not the most interesting to me, so I asked for something new and I immediately got to do something I enjoyed much more and because of this, I learned a lot more. So always be honest and have the learning mindset. And never be scared to ask questions.
