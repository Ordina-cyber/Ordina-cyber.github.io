Last week, a vulnerability in Gitlab was discovered. This concerns a vulnerability in Gitlab versions lower than these versions released on February 25:<br>
**< 14.8.2 < 14.7.4 < 14.6.5**

The NCSC has issued the following advisory for this: [https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/advisory?id=NCSC-2022-0139](https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/advisory?id=NCSC-2022-0139)
<br>

If you are using Gitlab (possibly at the customer), consider updating it as soon as possible to the most recent version. Since the risks have a significant impact, it is important that this update happens as soon as possible.

The updates and instructions can be found in the security advisory from Gitlab itself: [https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/02/25/critical-security-release-gitlab-14-8-2-released/](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/02/25/critical-security-release-gitlab-14-8-2-released/)
The vulnerability is in the Runner registration token disclosure through Quick Actions and is estimated at a CVSS score 9.6.

The chance of abuse is Medium, the damage / impact is estimated at High and consists of: DoS: Denial of Service, Bypassing security measures, RCE: Remote Code Execution and Access to sensitive data.

If your organization has additional measures in place, such as a VPN required to access on-premise / self-managed Gitlab environments, this provides an additional layer of defense (Defense in Depth). Nevertheless, it remains important to implement these updates as soon as possible.
