It is nothing special to hear about a cybersecurity incident; cybersecurity has become one of the most important aspects of any company that has IT systems.

However, senior management including C-level roles with less IT knowledge are often ignorant about the risks of cyber-attacks. Understandably, cybersecurity does not bring any value to the company, so let’s roll the dice and hope it will not happen... But a cyber-attack can set a company back by years. The incident may appear in the news and push away the investors and customers. The future of the company is depending on the mercy of the criminal when a cyberattack finally hits them. No company wants to be in that position, but any company can fall victim, and it does not matter how new or updated their IT infrastructure is.

So, any company needs an incident response plan describes “What to do in a crisis?”.

What to do in a crisis... any company should have an answer to that. An incident response plan lays out the steps a company needs to take when a cyberattack takes place. This way the effects of a cyber-attack can be greatly reduced or even neutralized.

An incident response plan generally consists of three major pillars: how the capabilities are organized of incident response, how an incident is handled and, how these are coordinated and information is shared.

There are several types of incident response structures:
- Companies with a dedicated cyber security department: this type of organization typically has multiple incident response teams, and each team is responsible for a particular logical or physical segment of the organization. This is a typical incident response structure in banks and large IT organizations.<br><br>
- Companies with a dedicated IT department: this type of organization preferably has a small incident response team that acts like a temporary project. This is a typical incident response structure in medium sized companies.<br><br>
- Companies with limited resources: this type of organization could outsource their incident response process to an external IT services company that helps with user awareness training, prepares the infrastructure with cybersecurity mitigation techniques and will present when an actual attack takes places.<br>
