A new version of the globally accepted set of security control
guidelines, ISO/IEC 27002:2022 was published on 15 February 2022.
ISO/IEC 27002 is a part of the ISO/IEC 27000 series and a supplemental
standard of the main standard ISO/IEC 27001. ISO/IEC 27001 is expected
to be revised sometime soon as well.

## What is ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27002 and what is the difference?

ISO/IEC 27001 is one of the most common frameworks globally used for
Information Security Management System (ISMS). Companies can get ISO/IEC
27001 certified and therefore this certification is obtained by many
organizations as a competitive advantage or as proof of trust towards
3rd parties.

ISO/IEC 27001 consists out of two main sections: the management section
and the control section Annex A. The management part defines the
requirements for the management system itself (based on a
Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle) and contains key elements such as governance,
resources, operation including risk management and performance
evaluation. The Annex A is a reference set of information security
controls and indicates what is expected by the standard to be
implemented/present. Not all of these controls are mandatory in order to
get ISO/IEC 27001 certified. ISO/IEC 27002 is the implementation
guidance of the controls listed in ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.

## What are the major changes?

The main part of ISO/IEC 27001 will not be changed, only the Annex A will be updated and thus ISO/IEC 27002:2022 as well. The biggest change is the number of control domains; controls were divided into 14 domains in version 2013, but now they are divided into 4 big domains in version 2022. Total number of controls was reduced from 114 to 93 even though new controls were added since many controls were removed/merged.

## What is the impact on your company?

If your company maintains ISO/IEC 27001 certification or is working
towards ISO/IEC 27001 certification, it is required to review your ISMS.
ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and ISO/IEC 27002:2013 were published more than 8
years ago and the IT landscape together with its technologies and
threats have been changed a lot in the meantime. Cloud service is an
example; lots of companies have been migrating their IT systems from its
own premises/data center to cloud services and therefore a new control
"information security for use of cloud service" was newly added to the
Annex A.

Nevertheless, ISO foresees a 3-year transition period when they revise a
standard. That means your certification will not expire when new ISO/IEC
27001 standard will be published, but only at the end of the 3-year
transition period. ISO/IEC 27001 certification expires after 3 years
anyway. In practice, you have to update your ISMS by the next
certification audit, if necessary.

However, as mentioned above, the changes are only related to the Annex A
of ISO/IEC 27001, the reference set of controls. In most cases, drastic
changes to the ISMS management part are not required but some additional
controls may need to be implemented based on your current IT
environment. At least the Statement of Applicability (SoA) must be
updated to align with the new control list.
